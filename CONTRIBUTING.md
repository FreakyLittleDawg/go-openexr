# Contributing to go-openexr

Thank you for your interest in contributing to go-openexr! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Linux Foundation Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version            |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| Go          | 1.21 or later      |
| Git         | Any recent version |

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/go-openexr.git
cd go-openexr

# Verify tests pass
go test ./...

# Run benchmarks
go test -bench=. ./...
```

### Test Images

For testing with real EXR files, download test images from the [openexr-images](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr-images) repository and place them in `testdata/`.

## Making Changes

### Branching Strategy

1. Create a feature branch from `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes with clear, focused commits

3. Ensure all tests pass:

   ```bash
   go test ./...
   go test -race ./...  # Run with race detector
   ```

4. Push and create a pull request

### Design Philosophy

This library follows several core principles that guide design decisions:

**Caller validates, callee assumes.** Public functions validate inputs at API boundaries and return meaningful errors. Internal methods and unexported functions assume they receive valid data. Do not add defensive nil checks to method receivers—a panic on nil dereference points directly to the bug; a silent fallback masks it.

```go
// Good: Validate at the entry point
func NewScanlineReader(f *File) (*ScanlineReader, error) {
    if f == nil {
        return nil, ErrInvalidFile
    }
    // ... rest of function assumes f is valid
}

// Bad: Defensive check inside method
func (r *ScanlineReader) ReadRow() error {
    if r == nil {  // Don't do this
        return nil
    }
    // ...
}
```

**Fail fast.** Return errors for conditions callers can handle (malformed files, missing attributes). Let programmer errors (violated invariants, nil receivers) panic—the stack trace identifies the bug immediately.

**Performance is a feature.** This is an image processing library handling large data. Avoid per-call overhead in hot paths: no redundant validation, minimize allocations, prefer stack over heap. Validate once at boundaries, then trust the data internally.

**Security through structured validation.** Malformed inputs are caught by validation at parsing boundaries, not scattered defensive checks. Fuzz testing continuously probes edge cases. When fuzzing finds a crash, fix it with proper validation where the data enters the system.

**Errors are for callers.** Return errors when callers can reasonably act on them. Use specific error types or messages that help diagnose issues. Avoid generic errors like "invalid data"—say what's invalid and why.

### Coding Standards

- Follow standard Go conventions and idioms
- Run `gofmt` on all code
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation for API changes
- Prefer short, clear functions over deeply nested code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Prefer early returns over deep nesting

### Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a brief summary (50 chars or less)
- Include details in the body if needed
- Reference issues when applicable

Example:

```
Add support for deep tiled images

Implements reading and writing of deep tiled EXR files as specified
in the OpenEXR 2.0 format.

Fixes #123
```

### Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Ensure tests cover both success and error paths
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Run tests with race detection before submitting

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run with race detection
go test -race ./...

# Run with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run benchmarks
go test -bench=. ./...
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Update documentation for any API changes
2. Add or update tests as needed
3. Ensure all tests pass, including race detection
4. Update the README.md if needed
5. Request review from maintainers
