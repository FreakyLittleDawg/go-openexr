## Previous Work: B44 SIMD Optimization

### Status: In Progress

**Goal:** Implement high-performance SIMD optimizations for B44 compression across all major instruction sets.

### Completed Tasks

- [x] Fixed GrainSize parallelization bug (was preventing parallel compression)
  - Changed default from GrainSize=4 to GrainSize=1
  - Resulted in 5-7x speedup for PIZ, B44, DWAA compression

- [x] Created ARM64 NEON assembly for B44 (`compression/b44_arm64.s`)
  - `toOrderedSIMD` - Sign-magnitude to ordered conversion
  - `findMaxSIMD` - Horizontal maximum reduction
  - `fromOrderedSIMD` - Inverse conversion

- [x] Updated `b44_arm64.go` with assembly declarations
- [x] Tested ARM64 NEON implementation (all tests pass)
- [x] Created B44 SIMD correctness tests (`b44_simd_test.go`)

### ARM64 NEON SIMD Benchmark Results (Apple M3 Max)

| Function          | Time/op | Values | Per-Value |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------ | --------- |
| `toOrderedSIMD`   | 2.3 ns  | 16     | 0.14 ns   |
| `findMaxSIMD`     | 0.88 ns | 16     | 0.05 ns   |
| `fromOrderedSIMD` | 1.4 ns  | 16     | 0.09 ns   |

### B44 Performance Comparison (Flowers.exr, Half-Precision)

| Metric     | Go     | C++    | Ratio       |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ | ----------- |
| B44 Write  | 1.35ms | 0.34ms | 3.9x slower |
| B44A Write | 1.40ms | 0.35ms | 4.0x slower |

_Improvement from ~6x to ~4x slower with SIMD functions. Further gains require vectorizing the inner pack loop._

### Windows AMD64 Benchmark Results (AMD Ryzen 9 3950X)

| Benchmark     | Time/op | Throughput |
| ------------- | ------- | ---------- |
| PackB44       | 300 ns  | -          |
| B44Compress   | 158 µs  | 156 MB/s   |
| B44Decompress | 60 µs   | 410 MB/s   |

### Cross-Platform Comparison (64x64 3-channel image)

| Platform        | Compress          | Decompress       |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| ARM64 (M3 Max)  | 68 µs (358 MB/s)  | 28 µs (877 MB/s) |
| AMD64 (Ryzen 9) | 158 µs (156 MB/s) | 60 µs (410 MB/s) |

_ARM64 is ~2.3x faster than AMD64, likely due to Apple Silicon's unified memory and newer architecture._

### Completed

- [x] AMD64 SSE2 implementation (already existed)
- [x] Windows/AMD64 testing - All B44/SIMD tests pass
- [x] Cross-platform benchmarks

### Inner Loop Vectorization - SSE2 Success

Successfully implemented SSE2 vectorized `shiftRoundSIMD` for AMD64 using `PSRLW xmm, xmm` for runtime uniform shifts.

**Key insight:** While the shift amount varies per block (runtime variable), it's uniform across all 16 values within a block. SSE2's `PSRLW` instruction supports shifting by a value in another XMM register, which Go's AMD64 assembler does support.

**Files created:**

- `compression/b44_pack_amd64.s` - SSE2 assembly implementation

**Results:**

| Platform              | Before            | After             | Improvement    |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| AMD64 (Ryzen 9 3950X) | 158 µs (156 MB/s) | 122 µs (202 MB/s) | **23% faster** |
| ARM64 (Apple M3 Max)  | 68 µs (358 MB/s)  | 74 µs (330 MB/s)  | ~10% slower\*  |

\*ARM64 uses unrolled pure Go since Go's assembler doesn't expose NEON USHL with register shifts.

**Technical notes:**

1. AMD64 SSE2 `PSRLW xmm, xmm` works with shift count from low 64 bits of second register
2. ARM64 NEON `USHL` requires register shifts but Go's assembler doesn't expose it
3. Unrolled scalar code on ARM64 nearly matches original inlined performance

### Notes

- HTJ2K dependency requires local go-jpeg2000 module (excluded for Windows testing)
- Interleave tests have an unrelated issue on Windows (not B44-related)

## Recent Session: Performance Benchmarking & Fixes

### Date: January 2026

### Key Findings

1. **GrainSize Bug:** Parallelization was disabled for complex compressions
   - PIZ (23 chunks) < GrainSize \* NumCPU (32) → ran sequentially
   - Fixed by changing GrainSize from 2/4 to 1

2. **Performance After Fix:**

| Compression | Go Write | C++ Write | Ratio                 |
| ----------- | -------- | --------- | --------------------- |
| none        | 0.53ms   | 1.93ms    | **0.27x** (Go faster) |

| zips        | 6.93ms   | 3.47ms    | 2.00x                 |
| zip         | 5.32ms   | 2.38ms    | 2.24x                 |

| b44a        | 1.27ms   | 0.34ms    | 3.71x                 |
